<hr/>

<p>
SuzyApp is a children’s reading and storytelling application designed for kids ages 2–7.
We take children’s privacy very seriously and comply with COPPA.
</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>
SuzyApp does not collect personal information from children.
No names, emails, locations, photos, or advertising identifiers are collected.
</p>

<h2>2. Parent Voice Feature</h2>
<p>
Parents may optionally enable Parent Voice narration.
When enabled, a voice identifier is stored and audio files are generated securely.
Voice data is not used for advertising or AI training.
</p>

<h2>3. Authentication</h2>
<p>
Anonymous authentication is used only to store reading progress and parent settings.
No login or personal identifiers are required.
</p>

<h2>4. How We Use Data</h2>
<p>
Data is used only to save reading progress, restore stories,
and enable parent-selected narration.
</p>

<h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
SuzyApp uses Google Firebase and ElevenLabs strictly to provide core functionality.
No analytics or advertising SDKs are used.
</p>

<h2>6. Parental Controls</h2>
<p>
Parents control sensitive features through a protected parent gate.
</p>
